### Tools I Use

Every good craftsman needs a good set of tools to do his job properly. Over the years a veteran craftsman will accumlate a lot of tools in his toolbox.

Working in design is no different. Over the years I have tried countless apps, programs, extensions and hardware. Some of them I still use today, while others have been replaced or are no longer needed.

For this weeks post I am going to list all of the tools I am currently using along with a few that I have used in the past but may still be useful. They will be divided into the following categories and sorted alphebetical so that it will be easier to find them later if you need. This is no way a comprehensive list of all the tools avaliable or even the ones that may be best suited for you, but it is simply a list of things that work best for me.
