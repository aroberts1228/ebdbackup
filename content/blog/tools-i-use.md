### Tools I Use

Every good craftsman needs a good set of tools to do his job properly. Over the years a veteran craftsman will accumulate a lot of tools in his toolbox.

Working in design is no different. Over the years I have tried countless apps, programs, extensions, and hardware. Some of them I still use today, while others have been replaced or are no longer needed.

For this weeks post, I am going to list all of the tools I am currently using along with a few that I have used in the past but may still be useful. They will be divided into the following categories and sorted alphabetical so that it will be easier to find them later if you need. This is no way a comprehensive list of all the tools available or even the ones that may be best suited for you, but it is simply a list of things that work best for me.

#### Apps
The tools listed here are apps that I use almost every day for a variety of functions. Each tool contains a link for you to download or learn more information about it. I am using a MacBook Pro as my primary computer, but most of these should also be available on Windows or Linux OS. Some of these also have mobile versions available on iOS and Android.

**Adobe CC** The Adobe Creative Cloud is a great way to get access to all of the creative apps that you need. Have all of our apps through the cloud makes collaboration easier and it ensures that you have all of the latest updates from Adobe. If the entire cloud is out of your budget, you can get the Photographers Bundle which includes Photoshop and Lightroom, for $9.99/month. This bundle also includes some cloud storage from Adobe as well. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html" target="_blank">Adobe CC</a>

**Atom** This has become my go-to editor for web design and coding. Atom is free and has the ability to code in any language you can imagine. If you edit code for your website, take a look at Atom and all the features it has to offer. <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>

**Caffeine** This is a nifty little app that sits in the computer toolbar. Simply click it to fill up your coffee cup and now your computer will not go to sleep. It is useful if you do not want to constantly adjust the computer power settings to keep it awake. <a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/" target="_blank">Caffeine</a>

**Dropbox** With a lot of features and easy to use interface, this is my favorite cloud storage provider by far. If the free space is not enough for you, you can get a business or team account that gives you more storage and allows you to easily share files between your team. If you have never used Dropbox, give it a chance. <a href="https://db.tt/n7Fx0Cys" target="blank">Dropbox</a>

**GIMP** GNU Image Manipulation Program. If you are into open source software or cannot afford paid graphics software, give GIMP a try. I personally used it for years before Photoshop became affordable and it got the job done. If you have used Photoshop or similar software before you may find GIMP cumbersome. It can do the same thing as Photoshop and other software but does not have all of the same hotkeys and shortcuts available in more advanced apps. While I no longer use GIMP, I do recommend you give it a try if free is your only option. <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="blank">GIMP</a>

**GitKraken** Depending on how much coding you do, you may or not use Git. If you are a Git user and get tired of doing it through the command line, GitKraken is for you. It makes it very easy to handle multiple repositories at one time and submitting your commits through a graphical interface ensures that you don't get stuck in VIM. <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/" target="_blank">GitKraken</a>

**Google Drive** While I prefer Dropbox for business file sharing, Google Drive is my go to cloud storage for personal backups and collaborations involving documents. Google Docs allows your team to edit documents and spreadsheets in real time. Google photos, which is a part of Google Drive, is excellent for backing up all of your photos from your phone and computer. With 15GB to start with for free, it is worth checking out. <a href="https://drive.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>

**Illustrator** This is my go to program when it comes to vector graphics. Most of my Illustrator projects are logos and icons, but I also use it in print design and other graphic design projects. Illustrator pairs really well with Photoshop to cover all of your design needs. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html" target="_blank">Illustrator</a>

**Inkscape** If you need a free vector graphic editor, Inkscape is for you. I have personally moved on to Adobe Illustrator in my work, but much like GIMP, I used Inkscape for a while because it is free and open source. Much like GIMP vs Photoshop, Inkscape can do most everything Illustrator can do, but it can be a bit clunky to use if you are familiar with Adobe software. If cost is the biggest factor for you, give Inkscape a try. <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>

**Lightroom** I listed Lightroom separate from the rest of the Adobe CC suite because many people use it as a standalone app. Lightroom is excellent for churches and photographers that take a lot of photos. Being able to bulk edit photos and export them into multiple sizes quickly sets Lightroom above all the other photo editing software out there. Lightroom has also become very affordable now that you can purchase it with Photoshop for only $9.99 per month. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html" target="_blank">Lightroom</a>

**Photoshop** Most of you doing design work are already familiar with Photoshop, but it is worth listing anyways. I use it on a daily basis to create everything from social media graphics to print projects. If you are not already using Adobe Photoshop in your design work, give it a try. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Photoshop</a>

**ProPresenter** After trying quite a few presentation programs at my church, we settled in on ProPresenter. There are too many options to list here in a post, but if you are looking for a better way to present your church media, check out ProPresenter. Many of our other software choices crashed constantly, wouldn't play the media we needed or simply would not do what we need. ProPresenter does it all. One point to remember is that there has been a lot of reports from users saying that ProPresenter runs much better on OSX than Windows. I have never personally used it on a Windows computer, but our iMac at church has never failed us with ProPresenter. <a href="http://www.renewedvision.com/propresenter.php" target="_blank">ProPresenter</a>

**Slack** This app is amazing. You can do all of your communications and group notifications in one central app. Share files, send direct messages as well as group-wide messages, make video and voice calls, get notifications from all of your other apps in once central location. Slack is your answer to group collaboration. If you are tired of juggling emails, group chats and projects from multiple apps, give Slack a try. <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>

**Toggl** You may think that you have no use for a time tracking app, but you should give Toggl a chance. When you begin to track how much time a project takes, it will allow you to plan better in the future to meet deadlines. Toggl makes it very easy track multiple projects and even allows other people from your team to track time on the same project as you. <a href="https://toggl.com/" target="_blank">Toggl</a>

**Transmit** After trying a lot of FTP clients, I have settled on Transmit. Using it multiple times a week to update websites is great. The interface is easy to use and not cluttered, you can save multiple favorites and even share them through the app. If you use FTP a lot, check out <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/" target="_blank">Transmit</a>

**Trello** One of my most used app on this list is Trello. It works as a to-do list, project management system, team collaboration and so much more. After using other similar apps, I keep finding myself coming back to trello. It works great to assign a task to people and manage group projects. If you have never given it a try, I would highly suggest you give it a look. <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>

#### Extensions
My primary web browser is Google Chrome, and over the years I have tried hundreds of different extensions to make a task easier and more efficient. Most of these extensions are available for other browsers, but for this list, I can only guarantee that you find them on Chrome

**OneTab** Tabs on your web browser are great, but if you are like me and end up with a bunch of them open at a time, you need OneTab. It allows you to "close" the tabs you select into one single tab as a list. This way they are not all open at one time and hogging system resources. Plus you can see them all in an organized list and open them back as needed. <a href="https://www.one-tab.com/" target="_blank">OneTab</a>

**Pushbullet** It took me a while to fully grasp the capabilities of what all Pushbullet could be used for. First, it allows you to "instant message" other Pushbullet users directly from your browser window or the app on your phone. You can easily send links and files through it as well. The best function however, is being able to send links quickly to other devices. This can be accomplished already if you have say an Apple computer, iPhone, and iPad. They can share browser history device to device easily. But, if you are like me and use a Windows Desktop, Macbook for your laptop, Android phone, and an iPad, it can be harder. Pushbullet simplifies that greatly. Once you start using it, you will wonder how you got along without it <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/" target="_blank">Pushbullet</a>

**Wappalyzer** This is a cross-platform utility that uncovers the technologies used on websites. It detects content management systems, e-commerce platforms, web frameworks, server software, analytics tools and much more. I use this extension quite a bit to figure out how websites are built and what systems they are using. <a href="https://wappalyzer.com/" target="_blank">Wappalyzer</a>

**WhatFont** Have you ever been browsing a site and really wanted to know what font they were using? Now, instead of searching through the source code to figure it out, simply install this chrome extension, activate it and every word you hover over will now display the name of the font being used. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en" target="_blank">WhatFont</a>

#### Mac Menu Bar

The tools I have listed as Mac menu bar apps run similar to browser extensions. They run in the background and are identified by their icon that resides in the top menu bar of OSX. Some of these apps may have Windows or Linux versions but are primarily used by Mac computers.

**Better Snap Tool** Windows already snaps windows together or to the edges of your screen by dragging them. OSX does not have this built in, but this little app gives you this feature plus a few more when resizing your windows. If you work with multiple windows open on your Mac, this tool will benefit you greatly. <a href="https://www.boastr.net/bettersnaptool/" target="_blank">Better Snap Tool</a>

**Clip Menu** When working on design projects, there is a good chance that you do a lot of copy and paste. Clip Menu keeps the things you copy and pastes in a history. This allows you to copy and paste things frequently without having to go back to the original document. It is very customizable and even allows you to create folders and organize things that you copy and paste a lot. <a href="http://www.clipmenu.com/" target="_blank">Clip Menu</a>

**Color Snapper** This app is the best macOS color picker app for designers & developers which make it easy to collect, adjust, organize and export colors of any pixel on the screen. All you have to do is press the hotkey to bring up the magnifying glass. Select the color and it will automatically generate the color into several different formats such as RGB and Hex. This is one of my most used tools. <a href="https://colorsnapper.com/" target="_blank">Color Snapper</a>

#### Websites

Here is a small list of websites to add to your design resources.

**Church Motion Graphics** This website has an endless amount of still and motion backgrounds to spice up your worship services at church. All of the backgrounds are really high quality and the prices are very affordable. My church has been using them for years and have yet to be disappointed with the new products they release every month. <a href="https://www.churchmotiongraphics.com/" target="_blank">Church Motion Graphics</a>

**The Stocks** A great website for searching multiple stock image resources in one place. You might already use some of the sites listed on this page, but if you are constantly looking for new images, try this site out. <a href="http://thestocks.im/" target="_blank">The Stocks</a>

**Unsplash** The absolute highest quality free photos you are going to find anywhere on the web. Discover the latest free (do whatever you want) high-resolution photos that are updated every day. I use Unsplash weekly for almost every project in my church. If you are a photographer looking to give back to the open source community, think about creating an account and submitting your own photos like I did, <a href="https://unsplash.com/@aroberts1228" target="_blank">My Photos on Unplash</a> or visit the <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="blank">Unsplash homepage</a> to browse all of the photos.

Thank you for reading this post and hopefully, you discovered some cool new tools to help you out in your design and productivity at church. Remember to check back next week for a brand new post as we work together to End Bad Design.
