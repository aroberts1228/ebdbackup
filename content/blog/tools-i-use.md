### Tools I Use

Every good craftsman needs a good set of tools to do his job properly. Over the years a veteran craftsman will accumlate a lot of tools in his toolbox.

Working in design is no different. Over the years I have tried countless apps, programs, extensions and hardware. Some of them I still use today, while others have been replaced or are no longer needed.

For this weeks post I am going to list all of the tools I am currently using along with a few that I have used in the past but may still be useful. They will be divided into the following categories and sorted alphebetical so that it will be easier to find them later if you need. This is no way a comprehensive list of all the tools avaliable or even the ones that may be best suited for you, but it is simply a list of things that work best for me.

#### Apps
The tools listed here are apps that I use almost everyday for a variety of functions. Each tool contains a link for you to download or learn more information about it. I am using a MacBook Pro as my primary computer, but most of these should also be availabe on Windows or Linux OS. Some of these also have mobile versions on iOS and Android.

**1Password** If you struggle with remembering passwords for all of your various accounts and websites, this is the app for you. Having tried various password managers, I found this one to be the easiest and most feature rich one.<a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a>

**Airmail** Do you hate having to go to a website and login everytime you want to check your email? If so, you need this lighting fast email client. This app contains quite a bit of features such as being logged in with multiple accounts at once, being able to choose multiple signatures with a click, reminders and a lot more. <a href="http://airmailapp.com/" target="_blank">Airmail</a>

**Transmit** After trying a lot of FTP clients, I have settled on Transmit. Using it multiple times a week to update websites is great. The interface is easy to use and not cluttered, you can save multiple favorites and even share them through the app. If you use FTP a lot, check out <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/" target="_blank">Transmit</a>

**GitKraken** Depending on how much coding you do, you may or not use Git. If you are a Git user and get tired of doing it through the command line, GitKraken is for you. It makes it very easy to handle multiple repositories at one time and submitting your commits through a graphical interface insures that you don't get stuck in VIM. <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/" target="_blank">GitKraken</a>

**Trello** Probably my most used app on this list is Trello. It works as a to do list, project management system, team collaboration and so much more. After using other similar apps, I keep finding myself coming back to trello. It works great to assign task to people and manage group projects. If you have never given it a try, I would highly suggest you give it a look. <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>
