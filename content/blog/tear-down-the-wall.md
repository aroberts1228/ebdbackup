### Tear Down the Wall (of text)

This weeks blog post will be tackling the issue that everyone has probably faced at one time or another. The issue of how much text should be on a worship slide, sermon graphic or even a postcard mailout.

It is normal to want to put as much information as possible into a design especially when it is something that will be used to advertise an event or special service. I struggled with this in many of my early designs and looking back I realize just how big of a mistake it was. Most everything came out looking jumbled and was very hard to read. You have to remember that design is not just about how something looks, but it must also be functional.

A pretty event flyer is useless if it is hard to understand the information it is supposed to give. A pretty background covered by top to bottom lyrics will give your congregation a headache trying to read it.

This blog post will be divided into two sections, digital and print, where we will tackle this "wall of text" issue.

### Digital

The two biggest areas where this problem exist is the stage projector for lyrics and verses, and digital graphics that you normally use for social media post.

#### The Projector Screen.

When setting up song lyrics to display, people tend to organize their slides by VERSE 1, CHORUS, VERSE 2, BRIDGE or something similar. This is normally fine except when a verse or chorus has quite a few words in it. You will end up with something like this.

A good rule of thumb is limit your lyrics to 4-5 lines per slide. In this case we have 6 lines of text so just divide it in half and make two slides. This is very easy to do in most all of your presentation software. We use ProPresenter at my church and when we split a verse into more than one slide you can still group them together and label them so it is easy to operate. This will give you a much cleaner look. Also, remember that you don't have to stretch your text from side to side. Let people see those beautiful backgrounds and make your text smaller but still readable.

See how much cleaner this looks. I also chose to add a slight drop shadow effect to the text. Do this for all of your songs and it will make a difference in your services. Your congregation will thank you, and they will no longer lose their place amongst the paragraph of text on the screen.

This same rule can be applied to scriptures. Many pastors and preachers will read from a passage of scripture during their sermon. Just like putting an entire chorus on the screen can make for a jumbled mess, a whole passage of scripture can have the same effect.
