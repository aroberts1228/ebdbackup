### Tear Down the Wall (of text)

This weeks blog post will be tackling the issue that everyone has probably faced at one time or another. The issue of how much text should be on a worship slide, sermon graphic or even a postcard mailout.

It is normal to want to put as much information as possible into a design especially when it is something that will be used to advertise an event or special service. I struggled with this in many of my early designs and looking back I realize just how big of a mistake it was. Most everything came out looking jumbled and was very hard to read. You have to remember that design is not just about how something looks, but it must also be functional.

>"Good design isn't just about how something looks, It's also about how well it functions"

A pretty event flyer is useless if it is hard to understand the information it is supposed to give. A pretty background covered by top to bottom lyrics will give your congregation a headache trying to read it.

This blog post will be divided into two sections, digital, and print, where we will tackle this "wall of text" issue.

### Digital Design

The two biggest areas where this problem exists is the stage projector for lyrics and verses, and digital graphics that you normally use for social media post.

#### The Projector Screen.

When setting up song lyrics to display, people tend to organize their slides by VERSE 1, CHORUS, VERSE 2, BRIDGE or something similar. This is normally fine except when a verse or chorus has quite a few words in it. You will end up with something like this.

A good rule of thumb is to limit your lyrics to 4-5 lines per slide. In this case, we have 6 lines of text so just divide it in half and make two slides. This is very easy to do in most all of your presentation software. We use ProPresenter at my church and when we split a verse into more than one slide you can still group them together and label them so it is easy to operate. This will give you a much cleaner look. Also, remember that you don't have to stretch your text from side to side. Let people see those beautiful backgrounds and make your text smaller but still readable.

See how much cleaner this looks. I also chose to add a slight drop shadow effect to the text. Do this for all of your songs and it will make a difference in your services. Your congregation will thank you, and they will no longer lose their place amongst the paragraph of text on the screen.

This same rule can be applied to scriptures. Many pastors and preachers will read a passage of scripture during their sermon. Just like putting an entire chorus on the screen can make for a jumbled mess, a whole passage of scripture can have the same effect.

As you can see the text would be quite hard to read from the congregation. Reading this much text in a book is ok, but it is a lot harder to follow along when on a large screen. In order to make this better, break up your passages to one or two verses each. It will be a lot easier on the eyes.

Now you can see how much easier it is to read your verses. It only takes a little bit more time to break them up this way, but makes a huge impact on how easy it is to read and how much better it looks.

#### Sermon Graphics and Digital Media

The wall of text problem is not just confined to song lyrics and scriptures. Many of times I have seen sermon graphics with huge titles or social media advertisements that are terrible to read.

**Sermon Graphics** can make a big impact when used properly. Many people are visual learners and while they may not remember the title or even the speaker of a sermon, they can usually remember something visual that goes along with it. Use this to your advantage and try to pick a photo that relates to your main subject or thought. There are several places to get royalty free photos and the one I use the most is [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com "Unsplash photos").

When you have a good photo to place your title on, let the picture speak for itself. Don't make the mistake of covering it in a lot of text. Below is an example of this.

![example sermon graphic one](img/wallsermon1.jpg)

Everything is easy to read on this one, it has a relevant picture, but the text that goes from edge to edge is very distracting. Think about where this will be displayed. On Facebook this image will be the width of your phone screen, so the text doesn't have to be that large to be readable. On a projector screen at your church, this text could be 10 feet wide. When you start thinking about that, you realize the font size does not have to be dramatically big to be readable.

Instead, use a smaller font out of the way and let the picture do the talking. You can grasp a better understanding of this by reading about the rule of thirds here [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds "Rule of Thirds Wikipedia"). See the graphic below that has been redesigned with this in mind.

Use these same ideas when making social media graphics or other forms of digital advertising. Here are a few more examples.

**But, rules are meant to be broken**
Sometimes its ok to break the rules and use a lot of text. Simple graphics without a photo for the background can have more emphasis with larger text. Look at the following examples.

![example slide four](img/wallslide4.jpg)

![example slide five](img/wallslide5.jpg)

![example slide six](img/wallslide6.jpg)

In conclusion with your digital designs always ask yourself the following questions. Where will this primarily be displayed? How easy is this to read from a distance? How easy is it to read on a small device? Do I really need this much info?

### Print Design

Your print design can follow the same basic rules as your digital designs. Make it easy to read and easy for your design to answer Who, What, When, Where and How(cost, registration or other details)

>It's always a good idea to use the K.I.S.S. method. Keep It Simple Stupid

Many times your print advertisements will drive people to your social media or your website for more details or for an action such as registering for a conference or event. Therefore if people will already be visiting more information, leave some of the minor details out of your design. This will keep it from becoming cluttered.

![example print one](img/wallprint1.jpg)

This postcard for a Hyphen retreat is a great example. The back of this card contained a few more details and a link to online registration. Since they were able to list all of the other details on the registration site, the front of the postcard was kept clean and simple. The smaller text really emphasizes the rest of the design.

![example print one](img/wallprint2.jpg)

The flyer shown here contains a lot more text than the postcard shown above it. However, it is physically a much large design which allows for more information to be displayed at a comfortable reading level. Even with all the information listed on this design, only the even name is stretched edge to edge. All other text is evenly spaced across the flyer.

Hopefully, this post has given you a new way of looking at your design work. Remember, sometimes less is more.
