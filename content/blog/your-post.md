Welcome to the End Bad Design blog.

My name is Anthony Roberts and I hope that anyone involved in creative ministries at their church can benefit from this blog.

Most of you probably attend a church like me and do not have a large budget for your printing, graphic design and other creative services. Maybe you are the entire creative department by yourself.

Regardless of your situation or department size, there are many things you can do to make your church design better.

We have to admit that for a long time things designed by churches have been pretty terrible. You have seen the flyers and postcards that are missing key information or look like they were printed on the cheapest paper around.

Maybe it is the social media graphics you see posted that would make clip art seem professional.

No matter what it is, there is simply no longer an excuse for bad design. There are so many affordable and even free tools available for use now that anyone can make something decent.
