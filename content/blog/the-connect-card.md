### The Connect Card

Let's talk about the connect card, info card, guest card, visitor information card, follow up card or whatever name you might use to get contact information from your guest.

Connect cards are something that you usually have designed, print a couple thousand of and then you never think about them again. You get used to seeing them, the staff gets used to them and sometimes your guest quit filling them out. Like most things, they should be evaluated ever so often and updated to fit with the growth of your church.

Below is an example of the connect cards we have had for years at much church and just recently designed them.
