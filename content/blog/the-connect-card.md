### The Connect Card

Let's talk about the connect card, info card, guest card, visitor information card, follow up card or whatever name you might use to get contact information from your guest.

Connect cards are something that you usually have designed, print a couple thousand of and then you never think about them again. You get used to seeing them, the staff gets used to them and sometimes your guest quit filling them out. Like most things, they should be evaluated ever so often and updated to fit with the growth of your church.

Below is an example of the connect cards we have had for years at much church and just recently designed them.

This version of our card served its purpose for quite a few years. The problem we had is that fewer people were filling them out all the way and they were not being turned in. After much deliberation on the subject we decided that maybe our card was too lengthy.

When this card had been designed, our church was quite a bit smaller in size and so we had a one size fits all card. These connect cards were not only for guest information but also served as a sign up for ministry, prayer request, more information regarding the church and bible study sign up.

These are printed on 4"x6" postcards and the majority of people upon seeing it was front and back would not take the time to fill them out simply because at a glance it seemed like you had to fill out the entire card. The problem we faced with simplifing our card is that all of the information that was currently on the card was important. So how do you condense your connect card while still retaining the important information that you need to gather? [Pro Church Tools](https://prochurchtools.com/perfect-church-connection-card-examples/ "Pro Church Tools") has written an excellent article, that I highly suggest reading, that addresses the information issue.

What I would like to do in this post is walk you through the steps we took in our connect card redesign and at the end of the post I will provide a link where you can download the PSD files of our connect cards.

The first step we took was to look over our original card and decide what the most important info was for us to keep. After that we looked at the information that had not been updated in a while or that had changed. After several weeks of back and forth we decided to split our front and back single connect card into four different one sided cards. Each card has been assaigned a different bold color and is labled on the front CONNECT, FOLLOW, SERVE and KIDS.

Our first card we will look at is labeled **CONNECT**

As you can see it is simplified greatly over our original connect card. We kept only the relevant information fields to get someone connected to the church. Here is a list of information fields we kept and a description of why we use them. Rememeber, every church is different and you have to find out what works for your community.

**Name** - This one is obvious, but you need someones name. We contemplated adding a blank for spouse so that families could fill out one card, but then we would need to add more blanks for separate email addresses. The thought process is that if you make the card simple enough and couple would not mind filling out separete cards.

**Email** - Our main form of contact at church is email, so it is very important that we have this field for someone to fill out. However, we do not spam people and we do not add anyone to our regular email list without them opting in.

**Phone** - While the phone number is not our most important piece of information, we still like to personally call our first time guest after they have attended our church. It is an easy way to follow up and thank them for choosing to visit our church.

**Address** - Most people would agree that traditional snail mail is outdated and the majority of people do not even open mail unless it looks official. However, our pastor hand writes a thank you letter to every first time guest at our church and we have noticed that this makes a huge impact. This can also make them more aware of postcards and flyers we send out advertising events.

**Children** - We decided to list a few blanks where people could write the names of their children. This allows us to communicate to our Sunday School teachers, Student Pastor and Childrens Pastor about potential new students that may be attending.

**How did you hear about us** - It is important to know where your guest are hearing about your church. This allows you to make educated decisions about future marketing stratigies. Is the majority of your traffic coming from online interactions? Are people noticing your sign out front when they drive by? Are guest being invited by church members and word of mouth in the community?

The next card we designed is the **FOLLOW** card.

Having elimanted everything but contact information from our connect card we had to come up with another card for people wanting to further their spiritual connection to the church. These cards are aimed at people who would like to have let our leaders know about a prayer request that they have, sign up for ministry training in our LIFE classes or be baptized.

The contact for our follow card have also been simplified to the persons name and email since that is our primary form of contact for the church and all that is needed in these situations. There is no need to complicate it by asking for all of their information all over again.
